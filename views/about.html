            The series revolves around the title character and an ensemble cast of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob
            SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic sea sponge who lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail
            Gary, who meows like a cat. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as
            a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. His greatest goal in life is to obtain a
            license to drive a boatmobile. His favorite pastimes include "jellyfishing", which involves catching
            jellyfish with a net in a manner similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate
            shapes.
